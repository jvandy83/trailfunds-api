# TrailFunds Demo

## Description

This is the repository that holds the code for developing the demo of the applicaiton. The demo serves the purpose of being a mockup that will demonstrate the desgin and base abilities of the app.

## Visuals

UI design that the app/website is working towards having: https://xd.adobe.com/view/8598f030-f1dc-443b-9c68-6ad7c87a752e-d0cb/screen/a6f2744d-e1ad-4c08-b20a-9b2f03477867/ 

## Installation

This app will be developed in a React Native environment. The first step to be done to set up the enviroment is to make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. To check if both are installed, run the following commands:
npm list
node -v
If the console returns an error for those commands, install Node.js with the link below:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Next is to install the Expo CLI. The only command required to install is the following:
npm install -g expo-cli
To have the app run on a phone now, need to have the Expo Go app installed on the phone (available on IOS and Android). Once installed, you can navigate to the TrailFundsDemo folder in the command line and run this command to run the app:
expo start
A QR code will be displayed in the terminal that can be scanned (on the app on Android, on your camera for IOS) and will run the App on the device. (In the future, everthing will hopefully be done by using Docker to set up the environment)

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
